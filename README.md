# Obesity Level Prediction 
"Data science is not just about algorithms, it's about making sense of the world." - Me, probably.

**Welcome to My Obesity Classification Project!**
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my capstone project for the Data Science Bengkel Koding course at Universitas Dian Nuswantoro. I'm building a machine learning model to predict obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition. Exciting stuff, right?

# ðŸ“Š About the Dataset
This project uses data from individuals across Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, looking at how their lifestyle choices correlate with obesity levels. We've got 17 features and over 2,000 entries to play with!
Some cool things about the data:
1. 7 different obesity classifications (from "Insufficient Weight" to "Obesity Type III")
2. Mix of eating habits, physical activity, and demographic info
3. Some synthetic data (77%) mixed with real user responses (23%)

# ðŸš€ Project Roadmap
Here's my game plan for conquering this project:
1. Week 1: Data Exploration 
2. Week 2: Data Preprocessing
3. Week 3: Model Building 
4. Week 4: Model Optimization
5. Week 5: Deployment (Currently here!)

# ðŸŒŸ Progress Updates
I'll be updating this repo weekly with new findings and code improvements. Check back often to see how things are evolving!
